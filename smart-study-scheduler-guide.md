## üß† Spaced Repetition Algorithm

### SM-2 Algorithm Implementation

The application uses the SuperMemo 2 (SM-2) algorithm for calculating optimal review intervals:

```javascript
function calculateNextReview(quality, easinessFactor, interval, repetitions) {
  // Quality rating: 0-5 scale
  // 0 = Complete blackout
  // 1 = Incorrect, but correct answer remembered
  // 2 = Incorrect, but correct answer seemed easy
  // 3 = Correct with serious difficulty
  // 4 = Correct after hesitation
  // 5 = Perfect response
  
  if (quality < 3) {
    // Failed review - reset interval
    return {
      easinessFactor: Math.max(1.3, easinessFactor - 0.2),
      interval: 1,
      repetitions: 0
    };
  }
  
  // Calculate new easiness factor
  const newEF = Math.max(1.3, 
    easinessFactor + (0.1 - (5 - quality) * (0.08 + (5 - quality) * 0.02))
  );
  
  // Calculate new interval
  let newInterval;
  if (repetitions === 0) {
    newInterval = 1;
  } else if (repetitions === 1) {
    newInterval = 6;
  } else {
    newInterval = Math.round(interval * newEF);
  }
  
  return {
    easinessFactor: newEF,
    interval: newInterval,
    repetitions: repetitions + 1
  };
}
```
